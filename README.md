# Python Basic Games

This repository contains simple Python games developed using basic Python concepts like string variables, control structures, functions, and the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These games are designed to be beginner-friendly and demonstrate the fundamental features of Python programming.

## Games Included

1. **Word Guessing Game**
   - A classic word guessing game where the player has to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.
   - The game provides hints based on the guessed letters.
   - Concepts Used: String manipulation, loops, conditionals.

2. **Number Guessing Game**
   - A simple game where the player must guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.
   - The game gives feedback such as "Too High" or "Too Low" to help the player guess correctly.
   - Concepts Used: Variables, input/output, random number generation, loops.

3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
   - The traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player competes against the computer.
   - The game uses random choices for the computer and determines the winner based on the rules of the game.
   - Concepts Used: Functions, conditionals, random library.

4. **Tic-Tac-Toe**
   - A two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game played on a 3x3 grid.
   - Players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) in empty cells until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
   - Concepts Used: Lists, nested loops, conditionals, functions.
